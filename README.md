### Why Annotated Papers?
I like to read lots of papers using traditional tools i.e. pen and paper. After annotating these papers, it is very diifficult to track those paper annotations, if I ever need to recall some of the notes. So recently, I have purchased an Ipad. Now, I am reading those papers in Ipad, it gives better control over my notes of papers when I want to recall something.
